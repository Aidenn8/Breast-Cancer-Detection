## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 

This project uses a resnet18 model that was retrained with two different sets of data. One dataset contained images of ultrasounds that were confirmed to contain malignant breast cancer. Another dataset was consisted of ultrasounds that did not show any evidence of breast cancer. The program uses imagenet.py to determine the whether or not breast cancer is present in an ultrasound.
